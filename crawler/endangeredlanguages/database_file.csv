(Cerrón-Palomino 1987.)

Alto Marañón Quechua [qvm] is sometimes listed as an alternate name of Alto Huallaga [qub], as both are Ap-am-ah Central Quechuan languages. However, according to some linguists the two are different languages, and according to others they are dialects.

This area corresponds to the Upper Marañón Valley in southwestern Huánuco; this variant should be close to Huallaga (Huánuco) Quechua (Willem Adelaar personal communication).","Peru;","South America","-9.932, -76.242"

There is no scholarly agreement on the genealogical classification of the Bezhta (Kapucha) language. E. Bokarev considers it to belong to the Dido subgroup, whereas Georgian linguist, E. Lomatadze, thinks it is a dialect of the Kapucha-Hunzib language. Bezhta is divided into three dialects: Bezhta, Tljadali and Hochar-Hota. The vocabulary has been greatly affected by Avar and Georgian, through which there have also been some borrowings from Arabic, Turkish and Persian.

Gildea (2012: 445) gives Kumaná as extinct, with Chaima and Cumanagota as extinct varieties of Kumaná. Crevels (2012:220) distinguishes Chaima and Kumanagoto. 
Ethnologue (Lewis et al. 2016) also has Chaima [ciy] distinct from Cumanagoto [cuo], both members of a ""Cumaná"" branch.
Crevels (2012) also distinguishes Piritugoto, with 50 speakers, saying ""further research is necessary to establish the degree to which it is still spoken and its exact classification within the Cariban family."" However, no linguistic data has been published on it (la lengua de los indios de Piritu) since the 17th century, and the current Chaima area coincides with that reported for the Piritu(goto). This suggests this is just an alternative name or a now extinct dialect.

Carrier (locally called Dakelh) is spoken in a number of local varieties, traditionally divided into “Upper Carrier” (the communities to the north of Fort St. James, around Stuart and Trembleur Lakes) and “Lower Carrier” in communities to the south. More recent research indicates that Lower Carrier should be split into a Fraser/Nechako dialect group (Prince George, Cheslatta, Stoney Creek, Nautley, and Stellakoh) and a Blackwater dialect group (Ulkatcho, Kluskus, Nazko, Red Bluff, and Anahim Lake). A Carrier lingua franca was established by Catholic missionaries (most notably Father A. G. Morice) in the 19th century, based on the dialect around Fort St. James, and a syllabic writing system was introduced.

The Parintintín, Tenharin and Djiahúj (Diahói) were one group at that time, and then they split in three different groups. Their languages are still very close, but their own feeling is that they speak different languages although they are intelligible. There are also lexical differences, different idioms, and morphosyntactic differences as well. And they are also differentiated culturally from each other in some aspects. Tenharin is the only language that is still spoken as the main language of communication by old people, and by some young people as well.

There is a distinction between northern and southern subdialects, the latter with coastal and inland varieties. The northern dialect is spoken in Whapamagostui (Great Whale River), Chisasibi (Fort George), and Wemindji (Paint Hills); southern dialects are spoken in Nemaska (Nemiscau), Waskaganish (Rupert House), Eastmain, Waswanipi, Ouje-bougamau and Mistissini.

Although they appear in some Colonial texts, the alternate names Huilche and Huiliche are deemed incorrect by some, as the graphemes ""l"" and ""ll"" represent distinct phonemes in this language.

It has its genetic origin in the ancient Uighur language unity. The Khakass language is an aggregation of different tribal languages, and it has achieved its present form only during the 20th century. More colourful dialectal peculiarities have been levelled by the unified language. Former tribal languages constitute the dialects of the Khakass language. The internal Sagai dialect is spoken in the regions of Askyz and Tashtyp (the Beltyr subdialect forming a special group), the Katshin dialect in the regions of Ust-Abakan, Altai and Shirin, the Kyzyl dialect in the Saralin and Shirin regions, the Shor dialect (NB! not the language) in the Tashtyp region.

The Inhokari dialect has in turn three vernaculars. Loan-words have been absorbed into the Khvarshi vocabulary throughout the centuries, from the Avar, Arab, Turkish and Georgian languages. In the 20th century Russian has exerted the strongest influence particularly in terms of political and technical vocabulary. The Khvarshi do not have a written language of their own, instead, they use that of the Avar. Avar has become the common language for communication and the mother tongue has been reduced to home usage within the Khvarshi community. The Khvarshi language has been little researched. The first records of the language were made by R. Erckert at the end of the 19th century. During the past 50 years it has been studied more seriously by E. Bokareva, D. Lomaishvili and E.

It is also difficult to determine how language variety names match similar names among the sources.
Campbell (2012:99) has 5 Nambikwaran languages. Lowe (1999:269): “Nambiquara family consists of three languages”: Southern Nambiquara dialect complex, Mamainde/Nakarothe, and Sabanes. Price (1978) has three branches, Northern Nambikwaran, Southern Nambikwaran, and Sabané. The Northern Nambikwaran members are: Mamaindê, Negarotê, Tawandê, Latundê, and Lakondê. The Southern branch is divided in four dialect groups: Manduca (with the variants Siwaisu, Hunkutesu, Niyahlosu); Campo (with Kithãulhu, Wakalitesu, Halotesu, Sawentesu); Guaporé (with Hahãintesu, Waikisu, Alãntesu, Wasusu); and Sararé (also called Katitãulhu).
Ethnologue (Lewis et al. 2016) has 6 languages: Sabanê [sae], Lakondê [lkd], Latundê [ltn], Mamaindé [wmd], Tawandê [xtw], and Nambikuára, Southern [nab].
Note that Negarotê has sometimes been considered an independent Nambikwaran language; however, Anonby and Eberhard (2008) found 90% intelligibility between Negarotê and Mamaindê, showing Negarotê is not a distinct language, but a variant of Mamaindê. (Anonby, Stan and David Eberhard. 2008. ""A Survey of Three Northern Nambiquara Groups: The Mamaindê, Negarotê, and Latundê."" SIL Electronic Survey Report 2008-21.)

Other sources differ by considering some of these to be dialects of a single Mapoyo-Yawarana language. 
Gildea (personal communication 2014) reports that until we get some more reliable data, it appears that there are/were 3 languages: †Tamanaku, Mapoyo (ethnonym Wanai, dialect †Pémono), and Yawarana (with alternate names Orechicano, Curachicano, Woquiare).  (See also Gildea 2013.) Tamanaku is long extinct, with no attested speakers for at least a century, and therefore does not have an entry of its only in this Catalogue. Mapoyo and Yawarana are often considered separate languages, each with its own entry in this Catalogue. However, there were just some old wordlists for Yawarana and almost nothing for Mapoyo. Marie-Claude Mattéi Muller went to the Mapoyo area in the 1970s and collected some data, from which she extracted a Mapoyo wordlist (Mattéi Muller1977a, 1977b). Mattéi-Muller and Henley (1990) published Mattéi-Muller’s comparative wordlists, comparing her Mapoyo data to the published Yawarana words; they found 80% cognacy between the two and suggested maybe they were dialects of a single language. In 1998, Mattéi-Muller did fieldwork with the Yawarana, where she played a 1970s tape of Mapoyo speakers, and the Yawarana speakers (i) had difficulty understanding, but recognized Mapoyo as very closely related, and (ii) recognized the manner of speech as that of an old woman living in an isolated village far upstream. She went to this old speaker, who turned out to be the last speaker of Pémono, which seems to have been a dialect of Mapoyo (Mattéi Muller 2003).

Some of these imprecise names include: Mayoruna, Mayo, Maya, Pisabo (Pisagua, Pisahua), etc.

For Fleck (2013), 'Mayoruna' names a branch of Panoan; 'Mayo' names a subgroup in that branch, which contains the real languages Matsés, Kulina of the Curuçá River, and extinct Demushbo. The names 'Mayo' and 'Maya' in the literature were homonymous with 'Mayoruna', and 'Pisabo' was said to be a 'Mayoruna' sub-tribe. A;lso, the name 'Quixito' was a homonym with 'Mayo'.

Ethnologue's Pisabo [pig] (600 speakers in Peru in 2006), and Crevels' (2012: 186) Maya (Quixito) (400 speakers, 400 ethnic population in Brazil) are subsumed here under Matsés as the primary representative of the Mayo subgroup.","Brazil;Peru;","South America","-5.283333,-73.15"

Por una parte, es una palabra de la lengua uitoto que significa “gente de abajo”. Con esa palabra fue designado, en tiempos de la cauchería, un grupo hablante de una lengua de la familia lingüística Bora, cuya auto-designación es Feenemɨna (“Gente del centro”). En un segundo sentido, ha sido empleado por Eugene y Dorothy Minor (Diccionario Huitoto Muinane, SIL, 1971) para nombrar el dialecto Nɨpode del uitoto, del río Ampiyacu (Perú). Sin embargo, hoy en día nadie utiliza la palabra “muinane” para referirse a ese dialecto. 

En algunos textos se trató de introducir la expresión “Murui-Muinane” como una mejor auto-designación, en lugar de “Huitoto” o sus variantes, sin embargo en la actualidad son los hablantes del dialecto Bue quienes se refieren a si mismos como “Murui” y el término “Muinane” se refiere a los hablantes de la lengua Muinane-Bora. (Juan Alvaro Echeverri Restrepo, personal communication, 2014.)

[The term ""Muinane"" is ambiguous. On the one hand, it is a word of the Witoto language meaning ""people below"". By this word, in times of the rubber trade, speakers of a language of the Boran family were designated, whose self-designation is Feenemɨna (""People of the center""). In a second sense, the term was employed by Eugene and Dorothy Minor (Huitoto Dictionary Muinane, SIL, 1971) to name the Nɨpode dialect of Witoto, of the Ampiyacu River (Peru). However, nowadays nobody uses the word ""muinane"" to refer to that dialect. 

Some texts tried to introduce the term ""Murui-Muinane"" as a better self-designation, instead of ""Huitoto"" or its variants; however, currenlty it is the speakers of the Bue dialect who refer to themselves as ""Murui"", and the term “Muinane” refers to speakers of the Muinane-Bora language.]

     ""El término “Muinane” es ambiguo. Por una parte, es una palabra de la lengua uitoto que significa “gente de abajo”. Con esa palabra fue designado, en tiempos de la cauchería, un grupo hablante de una lengua de la familia lingüística Bora, cuya auto-designación es Feenemɨna (“Gente del centro”).
     En un segundo sentido, ha sido empleado por Eugene y Dorothy Minor (Diccionario Huitoto Muinane, SIL, 1971) para nombrar el dialecto Nɨpode del uitoto, del río Ampiyacu (Perú). Sin embargo, hoy en día nadie utiliza la palabra “muinane” para referirse a ese dialecto. 
     En algunos textos se trató de introducir la expresión “Murui-Muinane” como una mejor auto-designación, en lugar de “Huitoto” o sus variantes, sin embargo en la actualidad son los hablantes del dialecto Bue quienes se refieren a si mismos como “Murui” y el término “Muinane” se refiere a los hablantes de la lengua Muinane-Bora. 
     La mayoría de hablantes de Nɨpode (o “Huitoto Muinane”) viven también en el Medio Caquetá, aguas arriba de Araracuara. No tengo una cifra exacta del numero de hablantes, pero puede ser del orden de 500-1000 personas. El dialecto Nɨpode es una variación de la lengua conocida como Huitoto (o Witoto, Uitoto). (Juan Alvaro Echeverri Restrepo, personal communication, 2014.)

     [The term ""Muinane"" is ambiguous. On the one hand, it is a word of the Witoto language meaning ""people below"". By this word, in times of the rubber trade, speakers of a language of the Boran family were designated, whose self-designation is Feenemɨna (""People of the center"").
     In a second sense, the term was employed by Eugene and Dorothy Minor (Huitoto Dictionary Muinane, SIL, 1971) to name the Nɨpode dialect of Witoto, of the Ampiyacu River (Peru). However, nowadays nobody uses the word ""muinane"" to refer to that dialect.
     Some texts tried to introduce the term ""Murui-Muinane"" as a better self-designation, instead of ""Huitoto"" or its variants; however, currently it is the speakers of the Bue dialect who refer to themselves as ""Murui"", and the term “Muinane” refers to speakers of the Muinane-Bora language.
     Most speakers of  Nɨpode (or ""Huitoto Muinane"") also live on the Middle Caquetá, upstream from Araracuara ... the number of speakers ... may be of the order of 500-1000 people. The Nɨpode dialect is a variant of the language known as Huitoto (or Witoto, Uitoto).]

Southern Sahaptin (or “River”) varieties were originally spoken along the Columbia River from the Dalles to the Umatilla River, and included Tenino, Wayam, and Umatilla. Northwest Sahaptin varieties were spoken in the Yakima River drainage and included Klickitat, Taitnapam, Upper Nisqually, Yakima, and Kittitas.

It says Khufi and Bartangi dialects may be separate languages, and Oroshani may be separate from Rushani.

Speakers of Bartangī, Orōšōrī, Rōšānī, and Šuḡnī can understand each other; one may say that they speak “regional dialects.” On the other hand, “dialect” also seems justified from a historical point of view (Lentz, 1933, p. 14).

Synchronically, the question “dialect of which language?” poses ethnic problems, as no generally recognized standard form exists. Even speakers of the most closely related Orōšōrī would never accept that they speak a “dialect” of Bartangī, and the reverse also holds true. (For the native classification see Sköld, 1936, p. 14.) It is accordingly preferable to call Bartangī, Orōšōrī, Rōšānī, and Šuḡnī “languages” and members of a genetically closely related “language group” (for this term cf., e.g., Heger, 1976) corresponding to the Russian expression “yazykovaya gruppa.” (Buddruss, G. 1988: http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bartangi-a-member-of-the-sugni-q)","Tajikistan;Afghanistan;","Near East",""

Intelligibility between these dialect areas is low, although speakers can communicate after a while with some difficulty, and they are perhaps best considered emergent languages. Sioux is further divided into three major dialects, Santee-Sisseton (Dakota), Yankton-Yanktonai, and Teton (Lakota), between which there is a fair degree of mutual intelligibility.
     Ethnologue distinguishes four Dakota languages: Assiniboine  [asb], Dakota [dak], Lakota [lkt], Stoney [sto].

Lincha-Tana; San Pedro de Huacarpana-Topará; Apurí-Madeán-Víñac; Huangáscar-Chocos-Azángaro; Cacra-Hongos;","","Sources differ greatly with respect to Quechuan languages and varieties, both with respect to which may be separate languages vs. which just dialects of the same language, and with respect to how to classify them. The question of how to distinguish between entities that are dialects of a single language vs. those that are separate languages is particularly serious in the case of Quechuan languages and dialects, and much work remains to be done. Though it is well-known and very clear that there are a number of distinct languages in Quechuan, some very distinct, the tendency to consider them all merely dialects of “Quechua” persists in many circles. (Cerrón-Palomino 1987.)

Southern Yauyos Quechua consists of:
 Lincha-Tana, Apurí-Madeán-Víñac, Azángaro-Chocos-Huangáscar, San Pedro de Huacarpana, and Cacra-Hongos (dialects treated in Shimelman 2017). There is also Chavín de Topará.
 
Cacra-Hongos is closest to Quechua I, possibly a Quechua I dialect itself.  The other dialects are Quechua II (some with heavy Quechua I influence).

Ethnologue has only Yauyos Quechua [qux] and does not distinguish Northern Yauyos and Southern Yauyos as separate languages; however, they are distinct (see Shimelman 2017). (Willem Adelaar personal communication.)

It is sometimes difficult to determine from reports which are the same with varying names and which are different with the same name. 
For cases involving overlapping names, Rodrigues and Cabral (2012:498) have among several others in their Guaraní Branch of Tupían: 
Kaiwá (Kayowá, Kaiowá, Caiová, Caiguá, Pãi, Pãi-Tavyterã) Brazil, Paraguay
Nhandéva (Ñandeva, Chiripá) Brazil, Paraguay
Chiriguano (Ava, Simba) Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay 
Tapiete  Bolivia (Argentina)

Ethnologue has: 
Kaiwá [kgk] (Caingua, Caiua, Caiwa, Cayua, Kaiova, Kaiowá, Kayova)
Ava Guaraní [nhd] (Apytare, Ava, Chiripá, Tsiripá, Txiripá)

Ñandeva [tpj] (Guasurango, Guasurangue, Ñanagua, Nandeva, Tapiete, Tirumbae, Yanaigua)

Ethnologue calls this language Ñandeva [tpj] (Guasurango, Guasurangue, Ñanagua, Nandeva, Tapiete, Tirumbae, Yanaigua); it may include varieties or languages others align not with this language but with others).

Dietrich (2007) considers the Chiriguano group to be composed of various dialects, with Tapiete a separate but very closely related language. Simba, Chané, and Izoceño are subdialects of Ava; the Chané are the modern decendants of Izoceño.","Argentina;Bolivia;Paraguay;","South America","-19.75, -61.6666666667"

The Teribes answered, tjer di, which means, ‘river of the Grandmother’. (The Grandmother was the protective spirit who controlled that area and to whom the Teribes went for help and healing.) The Spaniards corrupted that into Teribe and the name stuck (to the river and the people). The Teribes refer to themselves and their language as Naso which has come to mean ‘Indian, native’ but which probably derives from the two words na ‘here’ and so, sogo ‘owner’ to mean ‘the owners of this place’"" (Oakes 2001:3)","""The language known as Térraba or Brorán in Costa Rica is an almost-extinct dialect of Teribe with five elderly living speakers as of 1991 (Grimes 1996:60).

     It is difficult to get an accurate count of speakers; sources vary considerably for this, and it is difficult to get figures for the speakers in Colombia. Confusion seems to come from the fact that many use Tukano as a second language, and some counts lump all speakers of all Tukanoan languages together under the label ""Tukano"".
     Socioambiental (2014) has population numbers: 6241 (Dsei/Foirn, 2005) in Brazil, 6,330 (1988) in Colombia (and 11 (INE, 2001) in Venezuela), but seems to be including ALL Tukanoan languages in that – Crevels' (2012) numbers may be complicated by this. 
    In Colombia, the ""Informe preliminar: auto-diagnostico sociolingüístico de la lengua tucano"" (2009, done for the Ministry of Culture) identified 1,460 speakers of Tukano from an ethnic population of about 2104.

As the modern Estonian ethno-national identity came into being in the 19th century, the Northern variety began to be used as the standard written language of the emerging modern nation, and the Southern literary traditions which had existed until then fell out of use, while the Southern varieties came to be perceived as ""dialects of Estonian"". New activism in the written use of the Southern varieties arose in the 1980s, and new written standards for Võru (Võro is the traditional Southern form) and Setu (Seto) were developed. Originally the idea was to create a common Võro-Seto written standard, but the speakers themselves often objected. Although the differences between Võru and Setu are minimal (details of pronunciation such as the more ""Russian-type"" palatalization in Seto, stronger Russian influences in the Seto lexicon, the inessive case ending (*hnA >) Seto -h vs. Võro -n, etc.), the identities of the speakers are clearly different. Võru speakers regard themselves as Estonians, Setu speakers today often have a dual identity (Setu AND Estonian); until 1917, the Setu belonged to Russia, to the Russian cultural area and the Orthodox church, and culturally, they see themselves as a clearly distinct group. Today, Võru and Setu are used in writing to some extent but there are debates around the orthographies, and the general opinion among the speakers seems to be that they are two different languages.","Estonia;","Europe","57.8096, 27.29"

Several varieties of Massachusett-Narragansett are quite well documented from the Colonial period, including the dialect of the mission town of Natick, which was the basis of John Eliot's translation of the whole Bible (1663) and grammatical sketch (1666), and the Narragansett dialect of Rhode Island (Roger Williams 1643). Currently there are efforts to revive the speaking of the language under the name Wampanoag. The language fell into disuse in most areas during the 18th century, but a variety continued to be spoken on Martha’s Vineyard until the end of the 19th century.

Other sources differ by considering some of these to be dialects of Mapoyo-Yawarana. Gildea (personal communication 2014) reports that until we get some more reliable data, it appears that there are/were three languages: †Tamanaku, Mapoyo (ethnonym Wanai, dialect †Pémono), and Yawarana (with alternate names Orechicano, Curachicano, Woquiare).  (See also Gildea 2013.) Tamanaku is long extinct, with no attested speakers for at least a century, and therefore does not have an entry of its only in this Catalogue. Mapoyo and Yawarana are generally considered separate languages, each with its own entry in this Catalogue. However, there were just some old wordlists for Yawarana and almost nothing for Mapoyo. Marie-Claude Mattéi Muller went to the Mapoyo area in the 1970s and collected some data, from which she extracted a Mapoyo wordlist (Mattéi Muller1977a, 1977b). Mattéi-Muller and Henley (1990) published Mattéi-Muller’s comparative wordlists, comparing her Mapoyo data to the published Yawarana words; they found 80% cognacy between the two and suggested maybe they were dialects of a single language. In 1998, Mattéi-Muller did fieldwork with the Yawarana, where she played a 1970s tape of Mapoyo speakers, and the Yawarana speakers (i) had difficulty understanding, but recognized Mapoyo as very closely related, and (ii) recognized the manner of speech as that of an old woman living in an isolated village far upstream. She went to this old speaker, who turned out to be the last speaker of Pémono, which seems to have been a dialect of Mapoyo (Mattéi Muller 2003).","Venezuela;","South America","5.3863,-66.0058"
